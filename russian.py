##: The Russian Peasant's Algorithm
##: Been around for a long long time. (Seventeenth Century B.C.)

##: Multiply two numbers together.
##: Requirements: multiply by 2, divide by 2, and Add numbers

##: AKA =  Mediation and Duplation Method

##:
##: Inputs ->  two numbers
##: Output ->  the solution to those two numbers
##:             multiplied together using the Russian Peasent Algorithm

#                 1000 = 8           100010 = 34
